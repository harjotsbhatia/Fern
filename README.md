# Barnsleyâ€™s Fractal Fern
# Overview

The "Fern" repository contains a C++ program that generates Barnsley's Fractal Fern. Barnsley's Fractal Fern is a fractal that resembles a fern and is created using an iterated function system (IFS). The fractal is named after the British mathematician Michael Barnsley.

# Repository Contents

ass1.layout: This file likely contains layout information, possibly for an IDE.

Getting Started

# Prerequisites
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
(Optional) Code::Blocks IDE if you want to use the provided project file.
#Compilation
To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the main.cpp file and run the following command:

# sh
Copy code
g++ -o fern main.cpp
This command compiles main.cpp and creates an executable named fern.

#Execution
After compilation, you can run the program using the following command:

sh
Copy code
./fern
This should generate Barnsley's Fractal Fern.
